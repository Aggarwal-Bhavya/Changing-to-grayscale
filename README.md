### Aim
The aim of this webpage is to transform a regular image to a grayscale image. In digital images, grayscale means that the value of each pixel represents only the intensity information of the light. Such images typically display only the darkest black to the brightest white. In other words, the image contains only black, white, and gray colors, in which gray has multiple levels.
<br>
### Algorithm
Here, we use the average method (avg = (R+G+B)/3) to convert an image's pixels to grayscale values.
